  <strong>
    <em>Lorem ipsum</em>
  </strong>(/ˌlɔː.rəm ˈɪp.səm/
  <em>LOR-əm IP-səm</em>) is a dummy or placeholder text commonly used in graphic design, publishing, and web development to fill empty spaces in a layout that does not yet have content.</p>
<p>
  <em>Lorem ipsum</em>is typically a corrupted version of
  <em>De finibus bonorum et malorum</em>, a 1st-century BC text by the Roman statesman and philosopher Cicero, with words altered, added, and removed to make it nonsensical and improper Latin. The first two words themselves are a truncation of
  <em>dolorem ipsum</em>("pain itself").</p>
<p>Versions of the
  <em>Lorem ipsum</em>text have been used in typesetting at least since the 1960s, when it was popularized by advertisements for Letraset transfer sheets.[1]
  <em>Lorem ipsum</em>was introduced to the digital world in the mid-1980s, when Aldus employed it in graphic and word-processing templates for its desktop publishing program PageMaker. Other popular word processors, including Pages and Microsoft Word, have since adopted
  <em>Lorem ipsum</em>,[2] as have many LaTeX packages,[3][4][5] web content managers such as Joomla! and WordPress, and CSS libraries such as Semantic UI.</p>
